# ðŸ§™ InvisibleCloak

This project recreates the famous **invisibility cloak effect from Harry Potter** using **Python** and **OpenCV**.  
By detecting a specific color (default: red) and replacing it with the pre-captured background, the cloak appears invisible, giving the illusion of transparency. ðŸª„

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. Captures the static background for a few seconds at the start.
2. Detects pixels of the cloak color in each video frame.
3. Replaces the detected cloak pixels with the saved background.
4. Combines cloak-masked background with the original frame â†’ giving the cloak invisibility.
